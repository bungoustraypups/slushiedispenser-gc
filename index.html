  <h1>Welcome to Hell!</h1>
  <p>So, back on February 1st, 2022, we in a server called The Slushie Dispenser decided to create a roleplay section called "The Crossverse", which essentially allows our Bungou Stray Dogs fankids who come from different universes we've made to interact all together by saying "fuck you" to the boundaries of space and time. These are the logs of all of those group chats! This is the "home page", essentially, where I store links to all of the other sites.</p>
